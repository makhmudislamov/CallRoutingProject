Scenario 2: List of route costs to check

You have a carrier route list with 100,000 (100K) entries (in arbitrary order) 
and a list of 1000 phone numbers. How can you operationalize the route cost lookup problem?

# data structure for set could be hashtable, key = phone number, value = cost
# take into the consideration of longer prefixes
