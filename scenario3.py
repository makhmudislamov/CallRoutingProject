Scenario 3: Multiple long carrier route lists

You have 5 carrier route lists, each with 10,000,000 (10M) entries (in arbitrary order) and a list of 10,000 phone numbers. How can you speed up your route cost lookup solution to handle this larger dataset?

For the 3rd challenge:
* dictionary & BST
* sort the calling routing numbers into a BST
